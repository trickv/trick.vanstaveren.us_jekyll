  <h1 class="page-title">List of places I've been to</h1>
  <p>I’ve been all over Michigan on our bike rides - I think you should
probably just coat Michigan in little shiny stars considering all the
cities we’ve stayed in on various bike rides! Big stars on Kalamazoo,
East Lansing where I went to a lot of RHA meetings, Saginaw where Alli
went to school, and Ann Arbor where I’ve visited a few times.</p>

<h1 id="in-the-us-ive-also-been-to">In the US I’ve also been to…</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Illinois
    <ul>
      <li>Chicago (obviously!) and lots of suburbs</li>
      <li>Maybe you can find Aurora or Oswego on your map; Sarah lives in
Oswego and by best buddy Michelle lives in Aurora.</li>
      <li>Lena (northwest in the state) - stayed here on a bicycling trip</li>
      <li>Union - stayed here on a bicycling trip</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Wisconsin
    <ul>
      <li>Door county biking we’ve all done</li>
      <li>SAGBRAW ride which dad can find you the route for</li>
      <li>Madison - went to Adam’s frisbee tournament here</li>
      <li>Portage - went skiing here a few years ago</li>
      <li>Rode my bike (alone!) through southern Wisconsin on my way back
from Dubuque</li>
      <li>Madeline Island, north Wisconsin</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Iowa - a state I’ve only been to on bicycle!
    <ul>
      <li>Dubuque - rode to here from Lena, Illinois</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Missouri
    <ul>
      <li>St. Louis - went to a conference here with RHA</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ohio
    <ul>
      <li>We’ve been to some family get-togethers here but I don’t
remember cities very well…</li>
      <li>Matt and I have been to Oakshade (in Wauseon) a few too many
times for our health :)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tennessee
    <ul>
      <li>Nashville - on a road trip a few years back with work buddies</li>
      <li>Chattanooga - the second best named city in the country, next to
Kalamazoo, also on the road trip</li>
      <li>The tiny town of McCaysville, TN where I rode through the three
corners of Georgie, North Carolina, and Tennessee during a
100-mile ride starting in Georgia</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>North Carolina - as above</li>
  <li>Georgia
    <ul>
      <li>Atlanta, where Mel lives and I went on our road trip</li>
      <li>Talking Rock, the tiny little town in northern Georgia where I
camped for a few days and rode a bunch of miles…</li>
      <li>up towards Ellijay and Blue Ridge. I didn’t have the right
clothes so I bought a biking jersey from the Ellijay bicycle
club. It’s too small but it helped keep me cool!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Alabama
    <ul>
      <li>Adam’s military graduation which was in…Mobile, maybe?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Florida
    <ul>
      <li>The band &amp; orchestra trip was to Orlando I think</li>
      <li>We also went here when we were kids but I don’t remember where!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Maryland
    <ul>
      <li>Cycle Across Maryland bike ride</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Washington DC trip in high school</li>
  <li>New York
    <ul>
      <li>Syracuse for a RHA conference</li>
      <li>I flew into NYC once to drive up north to a client in White
Plains</li>
      <li>I drove 50 feet from Connecticut but my co-workers were anxious
to get to the airport so we didn’t go over to Connecticut.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Arizona
    <ul>
      <li>Phoenix on a bicycling vacation</li>
      <li>Sedona where I went hiking one day</li>
      <li>up to the Grand Canyon on the south side, even though I only saw
it at night!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>California
    <ul>
      <li>Irvine to visit Marie twice, both times with a bicycle, one time
I didn’t get drunk</li>
      <li>Ojai, a tiny town east of Santa Barbara, where I went hiking and
a bit of bicycling</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Not counting any silly airport stopovers, those don’t count. The only
thing I can testify about Newark, New Jersey is that Sarah gets really
giddy when you call her from there to tell her you’ll be in Chicago in
three hours and not three days like she was expecting.</p>

<h1 id="outside-of-the-us">Outside of the US…</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Canada
    <ul>
      <li>Sarnia for a camping trip with the Boy Scouts</li>

remember we rode east through Kitchener, Hamilton, and ended at
Niagra Falls</li>
      <li>I think we also went on a family trip to Niagra Falls? Or am I
making things up? :)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>England

to any other city in the world!</li>
      <li>Birmingham - northern England, where I went to the GUADEC
conference in…2007 I think? My first trip outside of North
America and first trip that needed a passport!</li>
      <li>Brighton and Hastings - south coast of England, on a hike</li>
      <li>Also been hiking all over Surrey, which is the area
south-southwest of London and also east to Southend-on-Sea for
an evening hike which was an adventure.</li>
      <li>Cambridge and toured the university</li>
      <li>And to a few small towns north of London to visit co-workers -
Stevenage (near where Steve Nuttall grew up, yes the name is
uncanny) and Luton, where a former employee of mine is from.</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>China
    <ul>
      <li>Shanghai obviously</li>
      <li>Suzhou, a small town outside of Shanghai, on a day trip</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Japan
    <ul>
      <li>Tokyo for an office visit</li>
      <li>Nikko for an overnight and hiking a nearby mountain (I need to
post pictures and my map to my blog, it’s the most challenging /
amazing hike I’ve ever done, and possibly a reason why mono
caught up with me!)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Singapore
