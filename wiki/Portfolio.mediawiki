For years, I have been wanting to put together a live demo of all the major websites that I've written/maintained as a portfolio, of sorts.

In the mean time, here's a basic version with links to websites i've worked on...someday I'll transport them all to this site. Enjoy.

[http://www.spectrumprinters.com/ Spectrum Printers, Inc.] - I didn't design the layout, but the entire code was reworked in my years at Spectrum for a PHP template system and everything.  I redesigned the layout using Photoshop changing the theme from green to blue a while back, and it looks a lot nicer.

The Residence Hall Association - This actually isn't my site anymore, but I'll get online an old copy of the one I wrote.  RHA love!

[http://conference.morha.net MORHA 2004 Conference] - Casey Hunt made the original design, but I made it a bit better, and I wrote the whole registration system for it.  This site has since been moved for future conferences, but I'll put online a copy of the site that I did eventually.

WASS - Web-based Advising Scheduling System - my senior design project.  Since this code technically belongs to the University, I'm not sure that I can publicly post it.  If not, I'm sure I can drop in some screen shots - it's pretty sweet :)
