From Sunshine.

To one pound of hamburger add one diced onion (medium or larger), salt and pepper, and enough oatmeal (I use the quick cooking oatmeal) and milk to make the mix kinda pasty.  Form into balls a little larger than ping-pong ball size and try to keep them even in size.  Brown on all sides in a hot pan with oil.  Reduce to low and cover, cook about an hour, turning as necessary to avoid burning one side.  It's important to brown them to keep the flavor in.
