Changes before riding:

-   (none)

Observations while riding:

-   No real changes
-   I might be getting used to the saddle
    -   *maybe*.

Changes while riding:

-   +10 miles: lowered saddle ~5mm
    -   Before:
        <img src="Img_0753.jpg" title="fig:Img_0753.jpg" alt="Img_0753.jpg" width="200" />
        after:
        <img src="Img_0757.jpg" title="fig:Img_0757.jpg" alt="Img_0757.jpg" width="200" />

Observations:

-   Big change from saddle lowering!
    -   I can spin freely now
    -   Feet feel better -- *less* numbness
        -   Right foot still went a bit numb (traditionally worse foot)
        -   Really only got bad towards end of ride where I was riding
            aggressively and tiredly, thus mashing the pedals a lot
    -   Butt feels better. Still not perfect, but better
-   Hands still in trouble
    -   Wrist related. Wrists are resting on handlebar, and most weight
        goes to that spot.
    -   Want to roll handlebars out / down so more weight goes on hoods.
    -   Maybe longer stem is the trick?
-   Mid-right back hurt, but might've been related to breathing / lungs
    sucking
-   Front derailleur might need to be turned slightly -- on large
    chainring, very little clearance. Should twist so back points more
    to the left?

Distance:

-   -   Odometer before: 44.8
    -   Odometer after: 79.5
    -   Distance: 34.7

Next steps:

-   Ride more!

Rode:

-   California -&gt; meander over to North Branch Trail -&gt; U-turn
    -&gt; Kedzie.
    -   Kedzie is much better than fricking California, take this more.
