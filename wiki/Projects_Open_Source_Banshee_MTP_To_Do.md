-   Fix everything on the [Known
    Bugs](/wiki/Projects/Open_Source/Banshee/MTP/Known_Bugs "wikilink") page.

<!-- -->

-   libgphoto2 is missing some functions (these are all missing at the
    ptp driver level):
    -   disk space level
    -   battery level
    -   time reading (and writing? synchronizing made easy!)
    -   playlist writing
    -   ability to read hardware & firmware revisions
    -   owner name

<!-- -->

-   Purging of empty directories at the end of a sync

<!-- -->

-   Caching of metadata (dangerous - how do we keep the user informed,
    or automatically check the cache status?)

<!-- -->

-   Generic reading from MTP DAP support
    -   Copying tracks from DAP to other sources (IImporter::Import
        methods)
    -   Playback?
