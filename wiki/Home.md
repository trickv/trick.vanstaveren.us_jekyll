Welcome to the personal site for Patrick van Staveren. Here you'll find
stuff about me and many of the works I've done over the years. If you
are actually looking to find me, check out my
[Contact](/wiki/Contact "wikilink") page!

I'm busy porting all the content from
[trick.vanstaveren.us](http://trick.vanstaveren.us) and
[wiki.vanstaveren.us](http://wiki.vanstaveren.us) over to here, in a
MediaWiki site. It's pretty basic thus far, but consider everything on
this site to be the most accurate if you find duplicate information on
any of my other pages.

If you are looking for something open source related, such as my
[Banshee works](http://www.banshee-project.org), check out
[wiki.vanstaveren.us](http://wiki.vanstaveren.us). It's most likely
there somewhere!

Curious as to what I've been up to lately? Looking for a boring read?
