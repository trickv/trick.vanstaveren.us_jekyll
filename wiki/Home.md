This is the personal site for one Patrick van Staveren.

If you are actually trying to get in touch with him, check out the
[contact](/wiki/Contact "wikilink") page!

I'm busy porting all the content from
[trick.vanstaveren.us](http://trick.vanstaveren.us) and
[wiki.vanstaveren.us](http://wiki.vanstaveren.us) over to here, in a
MediaWiki site. It's pretty basic thus far, but consider everything on
this site to be the most accurate if you find duplicate information on
any of my other pages.

If you are looking for something open source related, such as my
[Banshee](http://www.banshee-project.org)
[projects](/wiki/Projects/Open_Source/Banshee "wikilink"), check out
[wiki.vanstaveren.us](http://wiki.vanstaveren.us). It's most likely
there somewhere!
