This is the personal site for one Patrick van Staveren. I'm an American
expat living in Shanghai, working for [Mintel](http://www.mintel.com/),
running our IT Infrastructure team. I'm also a software developer with a
B.S. in Computer Science from [Western Michigan
University](http://wmich.edu/). I dabble in photography, and I'm usually
happiest when I've been on my bicycle all day long.
