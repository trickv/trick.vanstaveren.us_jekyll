Projects I've worked on:

-   [VyOS](http://vyos.net/), a fork of Vyatta Core.
-   [Banshee](/wiki/Projects/Open_Source/Banshee "wikilink")
-   [Universal DAP](/wiki/Projects/Open_Source/Universal_DAP "wikilink")
-   [lirc-sharp](/wiki/Projects/Open_Source/Lirc-sharp "wikilink") is a set of
    Mono bindings for the [LIRC](http://www.lirc.org/) Client Library.
-   [MTP](/wiki/Projects/Open_Source/MTP "wikilink") links
-   [XFCE XMMS
    plugin](http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/panel-plugins/xfce4-xmms-plugin).
    This was [a long time
    ago](http://trick.vanstaveren.us/wp/2012/03/24/my-first-free-software-contributions/),
    but I wrote the first version of it, and others have continued this
    code on.
-   [Packages](/wiki/Projects/Open_Source/Packages "wikilink") for various
    Linux distributions

You can also follow me on GitHub where I publish a bit of work:
<https://github.com/trickv>

I also have a bit of code in my self-hosted SVN repository:
<http://svn.vanstaveren.us/> (if it doesn't have a license file, assume
it's not GPLd, and ask, please.)
