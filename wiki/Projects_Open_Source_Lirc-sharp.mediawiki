lirc-sharp is a set of Mono/.NET bindings for the LIRC Client Library.

The latest pre-release of lirc-sharp is version [[Projects/Open Source/Lirc-sharp/Releases/0.0.9|0.0.9]].  This is a development version and I do not expect it to work perfectly for everyone.  Send bug reports to me [[Contact|via e-mail]].

This was designed and tested on lirc 0.8.0 only.  It should be backwards compatible for anyone running older libraries - the API hasn't changed in years.

I have written a [[Projects/Open Source/Banshee/Plugins/Lirc|simple proof-of-concept plugin]] for the [http://www.banshee-project.org Banshee Music Player].

I am also working on another project called [[Projects/Open Source/Lirc-dbus-relayer|lirc-dbus-relayer]] which will relay specified LIRC commands to D-Bus enabled applications.

It uses some C glue...if anyone's a real interop pro and understands how to keep a C file descriptor alive between function calls, let me know.  Maybe we can get rid of the C glue :)

Right now I'm keeping the code in my personal svn repository.  You can check out a copy by issuing the following command:

    svn co svn://sting.vanstaveren.us/trunk/lirc-sharp
