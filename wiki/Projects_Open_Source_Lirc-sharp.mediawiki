These bindings aren't perfect, but will make for a great starting point for anyone who wants to capture LIRC button presses in a C# program.

This was designed and tested on lirc 0.8.0 only.

I have written a [[Projects/Open Source/Banshee/Plugins/banshee-lirc-plugin|simple proof-of-concept plugin]] for the [http://www.banshee-project.org Banshee Music Player].

It uses some icky C glue...if anyone's a real interop pro and understands how to keep a C file descriptor alive between function calls, let me know.  Maybe we can get rid of the C glue :)

Right now I'm keeping the code in my personal svn repository.  You can check out a copy by issuing the following command:

    svn co svn://sting.vanstaveren.us/trunk/lirc-sharp
