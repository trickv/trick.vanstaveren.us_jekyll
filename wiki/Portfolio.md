For years, I have been wanting to put together a live demo of all the
major websites that I've written/maintained as a portfolio, of sorts.

In the mean time, here's a basic version with links to websites i've
worked on...someday I'll transport them all to this site. Enjoy.

[Spectrum Printers, Inc.](http://www.spectrumprinters.com/) - I didn't
design the layout, but the entire code was reworked in my years at
Spectrum for a PHP template system and everything. I redesigned the
layout using Photoshop changing the theme from green to blue a while
back, and it looks a lot nicer.

[The Residence Hall Association](http://www.rha.wmich.edu) - This
actually isn't my site anymore, but I'll get online an old copy of the
one I wrote. RHA love!

[MORHA 2004 Conference](http://conference.morha.net) - Casey Hunt made
the original design, but I made it a bit better, and I wrote the whole
registration system for it. This site has since been moved for future
conferences, but I'll put online a copy of the site that I did
eventually.

WASS - Web-based Advising Scheduling System - my senior design project.
Since this code technically belongs to the University, I'm not sure that
I can publicly post it. If not, I'm sure I can drop in some screen shots
- it's pretty sweet :)
