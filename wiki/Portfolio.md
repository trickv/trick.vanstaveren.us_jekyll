For years, I have been wanting to put together a live demo of all the
major websites that I've written/maintained as a portfolio, of sorts.

In the mean time, here's a basic version with links to websites i've
worked on...someday I'll transport them all to this site. Enjoy.

[Spectrum Printers, Inc.](http://www.spectrumprinters.com/) - I didn't
design the layout, but the entire code was reworked in my years at
Spectrum for a PHP template system and everything. I redesigned the
layout using Photoshop changing the theme from green to blue a while
back, and it looks a lot nicer.

**The Residence Hall Association** - This actually isn't my site
anymore, but I'll get online an old copy of the one I wrote. RHA love!

**MORHA 2004 Conference** - Casey Hunt made the original design, but I
made it a bit better, and I wrote the whole registration system for it.
This site has since been moved for future conferences, but I'll put
online a copy of the site that I did eventually.

[WASS - Web-based Advising Scheduling
System](http://portfolio-wass.vanstaveren.us/) - my senior design
project. Since this code technically belongs to the University, there's
no demo username/password and I will only give this out to prospective
employers. This site was put together in a real hurry - only about six
weeks of 10-hour-a-week during the development phase and a very short
testing & bug-hunting phase. The CEAS Advising & Admissions office has
been using this application during Summer, 2006 as their primary
scheduling system.
