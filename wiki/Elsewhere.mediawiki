[http://www.w3.org The World Wide Web Consortum] develops and maintains standards for Internet protocols.  Excellent reference for expert programmers (not for the young learners!)

[http://www.w3schools.org W3 Schools] is devoted to making instructional sites for coding by various W3 standards.  The "blunt" version of the W3 standards, easier to read, find, and search than the actual standards whitepapers, but not always completely up to date or completely extensive.

==Open-source related==
[http://www.kernel.org The Linux Kernel Archives] - the home of the kernel to the GNU/Linux operating system.

[http://www.kerneltrap.org KernelTrap] is a news site about the Linux and *BSD kernels.  A lot more fun than grepping through your mbox archive of the various kernel mailing lists for important info.

[http://www.gnome.org The GNOME Desktop] - an open source suite of software designed to provide a good desktop experience while also providing a suite of developer libraries to integrate applications further into the desktop.

[http://www.mono-project.org The MONO Project] - an open source implementation of the .NET runtime for C#.  An amazingly flexible language.  As with most open source projects, it's a work in progress, but it's really taking off these days.  See the [http://www.banshee-project.org Banshee Project] for an excellent show of it's capabilities.
