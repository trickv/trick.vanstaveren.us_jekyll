==About MTP==

Check out the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Transfer_Protocol Media Transfer Protocol] page on [http://www.wikipedia.org Wikipedia].

MTP stands for the Media Transfer Protocol.  While it is a standard created and used almost solely by Microsoft, it is becoming a popular interface for newer Digital Audio Players.  Seeing this growth in MTP players, the need for an open-source implementation became necessary.  Thus, a handful of projects were born to try to communicate with these devices.  libgphoto2 made some pokes & prods at MTP devices, and the libmtp project was established by some of the libnjb/gnomad2 developers in the desire to support these newer devices.  Since then, libmtp and libgphoto2 have joined forces and collaborated to help each other out.  As of right now, they are basically the same base of code with two different interfaces, and were originally forked from the same base of code (libptp2).

Banshee.Dap.Mtp uses [http://www.gphoto.org libgphoto2].

===Testing your device with gphoto2===

To get a quick test of whether your device works with your installation of libgphoto2, plug it in and open a terminal, and run:

  gphoto2 -L

It should list all the files & folders on your device.  If you get any errors as this point, you can safely assume that you will have trouble getting Banshee to work with your device.  You can ask for help with these errors on irc.freenode.net/#gphoto or on the [http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=8874 gphoto2-devel mailing list].  Be sure to mention this is a MTP device; the library here is actually a camera library.

If it's working properly, lets try it in Banshee!

==How to install==

Sometimes I keep some patches against Banshee CVS for MTP.  If so, you can find them on the [[Projects/Open Source/Banshee/MTP/Patches|patches]] page.

MTP support got really good in libgphoto2 around v2.2.2; so if you have a package for your distribution of 2.2.2 or 2.3.0, you are much better off using that.  I am tailoring these instructions against this case.

===Remove old packages===

Be sure that you have removed any old files from a Banshee install.  To make sure your system is clean, make sure /usr/lib/banshee and /usr/local/lib/banshee are both nonexistent - if not, find and remove packages or manually wipe out the directories.

===Packages to have / Prerequisites===

Please be sure that you have all companion -dev/-devel packages installed.  Configure scripts will fail if you are missing them - and they will act like you are missing the library itself.

* Mono
** On Ubuntu Dapper, this is: libmono0, libmono-dev, mono, mono-common, mono-devel, mono-mcs
* libltdl and libltdl-dev
* libusb and libusb-dev (Warning: libusb 0.1.12 was known to cause troubles when first released...do inform me if these issues persist)
* libexif and libexif-dev
* libgphoto2 and libgphoto2-dev

===Grabbing the latest libgphoto2-sharp===

Due to the quest for modularity (and some other reasons), libgphoto2-sharp is it's own separate module in subversion these days.

Snag yourself a copy of libgphoto2-sharp from subversion:

   svn co https://gphoto.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gphoto/trunk/playground/libgphoto2-sharp

Prepare the build like normal:

  ./autogen.sh && ./configure

Make sure there's no errors, and then do the usual:

  make && sudo make install

===Installing Banshee from CVS===

Grab the latest CVS version of Banshee:

  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome co -P banshee

'''NOTE:  this will change as Gnome is moving to Subversion (eventually).'''  If you're getting errors with this command, check out the [http://live.gnome.org/Subversion status of the subversion migration].  Ask in #banshee or #gnome for help!

Finally, run autogen.  Pass <code>--enable-mtp</code>:

  ./autogen.sh --enable-mtp --whatever-other-flags-you-usually-use

If you've never built Banshee from source before, and are using a standard gstreamer installation...use:

  ./autogen.sh --enable-mtp

That should do the trick.  Finally, make Banshee and install it:

  make && sudo make install

==Moving further==

===Testing it out===

First, check out the [[Projects/Open Source/Banshee/MTP/Known Bugs|Known Bugs]] page.  PLEASE, read it!

Launch Banshee like normal.

Once Banshee has started up, plug your MTP device in.  As long as all is well, the interface will show a little loading message as it reads the track information from the device.  Be patient, it can take quite some time to load up - on my system, it can process about ten tracks per second.  This is a protocol limitation that hopefully we can get past :)

If you do not see anything, try running Banshee in debug mode (run <code>banshee --debug</code> at a terminal), go to the Help menu, and click View Debugging Messages.  You should see some messages from the MTP driver trying to find your device; copy all this information down and [http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=banshee&component=MTP submit a bug report].

Once the message disappears, you should be ready to go!  Drag 'n drop some tracks on the device, and run a Synchronize to see if it works.  Not only can you drag mp3's, but also ogg and flac (and possibly even other formats) to the device and they will be transcoded and then transferred to the device.  In my experience this has been flawless.

Removing tracks from the device is easy.  Just right click the file and hit Remove, and then run Synchronize.

Editing of Metadata is possible, but has been disabled because of some strange conflicts and crashes with the CVS updates.  This will most likely be sorted out in the future.

Playback does not work at all.  It might someday, but not for now.

===Playlists===

Playlists don't work.  Not yet.  But, they're in the works...[[Projects/Open Source/Banshee/MTP/Playlists|playlist]] support is coming...

===Reporting Bugs===

Please, by all means, report bugs.  There are so many possible bugs in this code that I just won't discover myself, and this can be a good piece of software if you help me out.  File bugs on the [http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=banshee&component=MTP Gnome Bugzilla, product banshee, component MTP].

===Sending Patches===

As with reporting bugs, patches are more than welcome.  I've been experiencing a few troubles, particularly with shutting down banshee after making a transfer.  I'm pretty sure that they're native-code related, but I have no clue where (as of yet).  Please post patches to bugzilla!

===Icons===

I'm working on some icons [[Projects/Open_Source/Banshee/MTP/Icons|here]].
