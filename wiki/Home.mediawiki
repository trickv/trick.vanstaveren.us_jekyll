This is the personal site for one Patrick van Staveren.  I'm an American expat living in <del>Shanghai</del> London, working for [http://www.mintel.com/ Mintel], running our IT Infrastructure team.  I studied as a software developer with a B.S. in Computer Science from [http://wmich.edu/ Western Michigan University] and worked as a developer for 5 years before moving around and eventually landing as a manager of system administrators.  I dabble in photography, and I'm usually happiest when I've been on my bicycle all day long.
