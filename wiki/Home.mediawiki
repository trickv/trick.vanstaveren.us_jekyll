This is the personal site for one Patrick van Staveren.

If you are actually trying to get in touch with him, check out the [[Contact|contact]] page!

I'm busy porting all the content from [http://trick.vanstaveren.us trick.vanstaveren.us] and [http://wiki.vanstaveren.us wiki.vanstaveren.us] over to here.  It's pretty basic thus far, but consider everything on this site to be the most accurate if you find duplicate information on any of my other pages.

If you are looking for something open source related, such as my [http://www.banshee-project.org Banshee] [[Projects/Open_Source/Banshee|projects]], check out [http://wiki.vanstaveren.us wiki.vanstaveren.us].  It's most likely there somewhere!
