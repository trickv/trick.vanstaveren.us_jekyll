-   Shutdown causes segfaults and glib free errors, but only after doing
    a sync. I have yet to figure out where this is coming from.

-   Metadata editing has been implemented and works, but ran into a bug
    as CVS HEAD progressed around April. Never found the source of the
    problem. This causes Edit Metadata to crash Banshee. Don't use it!
