Q: What does this mess mean when I run <code>autogen.sh</code> in libgphoto2?
 > ./autogen.sh
 Looking for `./configure.{ac,in}'... ./configure.in
 autogen.sh:init: Entering directory `.'
 ls: libltdl/*: No such file or directory
 libtoolize: cannot list files in `/usr/share/libtool/libltdl'
 Could not create libltdl directory `libltdl'.
 Leaving `/home/jonathan/libgphoto2' and aborting.
 autogen.sh:init: Left directory `.'
A: You are missing libltdl.  Be sure to install it!
