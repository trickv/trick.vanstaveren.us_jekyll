* libgphoto2 is missing some functions (these are all missing at the ptp driver level):
** disk space level
** battery level
** time reading (and writing? synchronizing made easy!)
** playlist writing
** ability to read hardware & firmware revisions
** owner name

* Purging of empty directories at the end of a sync

* Caching of metadata (dangerous - how do we keep the user informed, or automatically check the cache status?)

* Copying tracks from DAP to other sources (IImporter::Import methods)
