Changes before riding:
* (none)

Observations while riding:
* No real changes
* I might be getting used to the saddle
** ''maybe''.

Changes while riding:
* +10 miles: lowered saddle ~5mm
** Before: [[Image:Img 0753.jpg|200px]] after: [[Image:Img 0757.jpg|200px]]

Observations:
* Big change from saddle lowering!
** I can spin freely now
** Feet feel better -- ''less'' numbness
*** Right foot still went a bit numb (traditionally worse foot)
*** Really only got bad towards end of ride where I was riding aggressively and tiredly, thus mashing the pedals a lot
** Butt feels better.  Still not perfect, but better
* Hands still in trouble
** Wrist related.  Wrists are resting on handlebar, and most weight goes to that spot.
** Want to roll handlebars out / down so more weight goes on hoods.
** Maybe longer stem is the trick?
* Mid-right back hurt, but might've been related to breathing / lungs sucking
* Front derailleur might need to be turned slightly -- on large chainring, very little clearance.  Should twist so back points more to the left?

Distance:
** Odometer before: 44.8
** Odometer after: 79.5
** Distance: 34.7

Next steps:
* Ride more!

Rode:
* California -> meander over to North Branch Trail -> U-turn -> Kedzie.
** Kedzie is much better than fricking California, take this more.
