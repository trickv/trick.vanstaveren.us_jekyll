Changes before riding:

-   New gloves (performance terry)
-   New shorts (performance century)

Observations while riding:

-   Handlebar is not on straight! Left side is further forward from
    right.
-   Saddle feels better (especially at first, probably due to new
    shorts) but hurts after five miles.
-   Feet still having same historical problem (going numb). Particularly
    right foot; middle toes go numb.
-   Hands still hurt. Sometimes wrists hurt associated with numbness,
    but shuffling hands fixes it.
-   Lots of hokey pokey helps.

Changes while riding:

-   Straightened handlebar at Turin

Next steps:

-   Ride 50-100 miles

Rode from:

-   home -&gt; Turin (break)
