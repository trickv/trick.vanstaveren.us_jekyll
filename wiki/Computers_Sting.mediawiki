Sting, my fabulous dual P2-350 128meg ram server/firewall/etc box.

Sting has been my firewall now for almost four years, and all I've had to replace on it is some bad ram and a bad hard drive.  My best uptime was something like 80 days, but the best I have on record is "22:14:06 up 53 days, 21:05, 1 user, load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00".  Once I get down to Chicago and have some cash to buy it a backup battery, expect huge numbers :)

It runs lots of fun software, built on top of Slackware 10.2 w/ Dropline Gnome 2.14:
* Apache 2.0 web server, with mod_mono & PHP 5
** hosts lots of little bits 'n pieces of fun stuff, including iFolder
* iFolder 3.5 server (instructions will come soon on [[Log]])
* SSH, FTP, TightVNC services
* Testing box for the [http://www.horde.org/ Horde Application Framework] CVS.
* Subversion server
* Netfilter firewall
** w/ traffic shaping marking and l7_filter added on
** Port forwarding stuff for [[Computers/Mc|mc]]
