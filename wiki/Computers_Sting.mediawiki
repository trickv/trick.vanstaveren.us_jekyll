=== What It Is ===
Sting is my dual P2-350 <del>128meg</del> 256meg [http://www.motherboard.cz/mb/asus/P2B-D.htm Asus P2B-D] webserver/router/firewall/backup/you-name-it box.

It is named for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Middle-earth_weapons_and_armour#Sting the dagger] which Bilbo and later Frodo used in ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord Of The Rings''.

=== History ===
Sting has been my home network keystone since about 2004.  It's an old slow dog that never quits.

=== The Uptime Saga ===
* Back in college, I was excited when it hit uptimes of 90 and 53 days.
* I moved to Chicago in 2006 and made some money, and bought a UPS.  That helped.
* After a year, living at my Hutchinson St apartment, the uptime grew.  It prompted me to write a simple [http://vanstaveren.us/~trick/uptime/ uptime tracking service for my computers], so I would have a proper record aside this page.
* Less than 12 hours before I moved out of that apartment, it crashed due to a disk controller fault at an uptime of 279 days.
* I moved to my Washtenaw Ave apartment in 2008, replaced the disk controller and disks with hand-me-down SATA disks, and left it on from December 2008 onwards.
* In May 2010, I moved from the ground floor to the top floor of the apartment on Washtenaw Ave.  I planned and executed a successful move of Sting whilst on, with it's UPS in hand!
* On November 1st 2010, the [[:Image:IMG 20101101 211542.jpg|power supply in Sting finally gave way]] and it died in the middle of the night, at 687 days up.  94% of the way to two years.  I replaced the power supply with a [[:Image:IMG 4120.jpg|new gigantic one]] from Cooler Master.

I may never beat 687 days with a real physical computer of my own.  [[Computers/Sam|Sam]], my linode has proven to be reasonably stable and may someday go years, but it's not the same challenge.

=== Software ===

Sting runs [http://www.gnu.org/ GNU]/[http://kernel.org/ Linux] with a 2.6 kernel.  It's primary based on [http://www.slackware.org/ Slackware 10.2] and [http://www.droplinegnome.org/ Dropline Gnome 2.14] with a 2.4 kernel.

It has been massively upgraded over the years.  2.4 to 2.6 was a bit of a challenge, and I've found my <tt>/usr/local</tt> to be extensive.

It runs lots of fun services like:
* Apache 2.0 web server with PHP 5
* SSH and OpenVPN servers
* Exim SMTP server
* Subversion server
* Internal services like a Netfilter firewall, VPN bridge and DHCP server, DNS server with custom records and an NTP server.
* Tunnels or proxies several services from [[Computers/Mc|mc]] for music sharing.
