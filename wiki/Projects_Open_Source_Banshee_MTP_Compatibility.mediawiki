The only actual tested device is, of course, my Creative Zen Micro, which is known to work fine.

I've been in touch with a user with a Creative Portable Media Center which seemed to have some filesystem issues at the gphoto level.  I don't know where that one went...

I "hear" that some iRiver devices don't work perfectly yet with libgphoto2...

Of course, if you'd like to donate me a MTP player of any brand or sorts, I'll be happy to make it work for you :)

----

Whether or not your player is compatible with Banshee's MTP support depends on [http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/gphoto/trunk/libgphoto2/camlibs/ptp2/library.c libgphoto2's device list], and my [http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/*checkout*/banshee/src/Banshee.Dap/Mtp/MtpDeviceId.cs device list] in Banshee's MTP driver.


The following devices are known MTP devices, recognized by libgphoto2.  This is a direct snap from my codebase which filters out non-MTP devices.  If you have a MTP player that's not on this list, Banshee will refuse to recognize it - [[Contact|e-mail me]] and I'll help you out ASAP :)
