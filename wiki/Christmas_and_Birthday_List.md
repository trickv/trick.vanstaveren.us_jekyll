### Clothes

-   Dress shirts: 17.5 or 18 neck, 36/37 sleeves. Don't buy anything
    shorter or smaller. 2XL if it is just simple sizing, but look for a
    long version (monkey arms).
-   Pants: 42x32. Need jeans (be sure they're loose), and can always use
    more dress pants.

### Biking Stuff

-   Moutain Bike Tires (not sure of size)
-   Set of road tires - Armadillo or some other flat protection
    technology. 700xSomethingCC. (not sure of size yet)
-   Bike Trainer (Emily has this covered)
-   Cyclocomputer for mountain bike. Doesn't need to be anything fancy.
-   Wheel truing stand
-   Long sleeve t-shirts for riding (no silky jerseys or anything)
-   Some sort of simple, under-the-seat bag (mountain bike)
-   New headlight, one that uses LEDs rather than nasty halogens that
    kill batteries.
