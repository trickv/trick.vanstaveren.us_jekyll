* We're assuming the device has ONLY mp3's on it.  It does not show anything without the mp3 mime type on the device.  It's possible to have WMA's on there from use with WMP, as well as WAV files (from voice recording or something).

* Shutdown causes segfaults and glib free errors.  I have yet to figure out where this is coming from.

* Metadata editing has been implemented and works, but ran into a bug as CVS HEAD progressed around April.  Never found the source of the problem.  This causes Edit Metadata to crash Banshee.  Don't use it!

* libgphoto2_port's disk driver must be making some hal calls, because Banshee.Dap.Mtp looses it's hal information right when we first run a device scan with libgphoto2.  The workaround is to remove the disk driver:

  sudo rm /usr/local/lib/libgphoto2_port/0.6.1/disk.*
