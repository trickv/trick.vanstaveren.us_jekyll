This is the personal site of Patrick van Staveren. I work for
[Mintel](http://www.mintel.com/), running our [IT](https://medium.com/mintel-tech-blog)
Infrastructure team.
I grew up in Michigan,
studied as a software developer with a B.S. in Computer Science from
[Western Michigan University](http://wmich.edu/) and worked as a
developer for 5 years in Chicago before moving around the globe
and eventually landing as a manager of system administrators.
I spent a few years living in [Shanghai](http://trick.vanstaveren.us/wp/2015/07/09/four-years-in-shanghai-without-a-doubt-the-coolest-thing-ive-ever-done-%E5%86%8D%E8%A7%81%E4%B8%8A%E6%B5%B7%EF%BC%81/) and [London](#) while working for Mintel and now live back in the suburbs of Chicago.
I dabble in photography, and I'm
usually happiest when I've been on my bicycle all day long.
