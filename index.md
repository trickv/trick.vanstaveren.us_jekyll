This is the personal site for one Patrick van Staveren. I'm an American
expat living in ~~Shanghai~~ London, working for
[Mintel](http://www.mintel.com/), running our IT Infrastructure team. I
studied as a software developer with a B.S. in Computer Science from
[Western Michigan University](http://wmich.edu/) and worked as a
developer for 5 years before moving around and eventually landing as a
manager of system administrators. I dabble in photography, and I'm
usually happiest when I've been on my bicycle all day long.
